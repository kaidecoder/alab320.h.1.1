# ALAB 320H.1.1 - React Page Layout

This is the first lab in the Learn React series which deals with creating and naming components, using a mockup.
To consume this lab from GitHub, once you have navigated to this project, look for the green "CODE" button. Click that, highlight "HTTPS" and copy the link underneath. In your terminal, create the folder you want to hold this project. CD into that folder, then type "git clone " into your terminal to begin the process. Continue by then pasting the string you copied. Now finally, enter a "." after a space at the end. You should see "git clone + pasted text from github + ." Hit the enter key. This repo will be copied to your folder. Now you must type "npm install" and "npm run dev" to install all dependencies and start the server. 

## Learning Objectives

Create a page from a mockup using React.
